Methods:
1. FleetList.js

 1.1 redirectCars (sorry naming is confusing) : it will redirect to vehicle page with fleetId. Here it will use react-router's history.push mehtod.

2. VehicleList.js
  
  2.1 handleDelete : It will delete vehicle from list. Also uses confirm dialog in it before delete.

  2.2 handleChange : It will used to open location update popup to change location of particular vehicle.

  2.3 handleAdd: It will open popup dialog box to show new vehicle info form to add new vehicle.

  2.4 handleClose: It will used to close popup dialog box and clear data.

  2.5 handleSave: It will add new vehicle info in to particular fleet's vehicle list or update existing vehicle for location change.

  2.6   handleFieldChange: This will used to set vehicle values on change location time or when we add new record, related to input's onchange Methods.

3. context.js
  
  3.1 setVehicles: It will update vehicle list of given fleetId.

  3.2 useUserStore: It will return context props which are provided in value. 
      ex. we set const 
      value = {
            state,
            setVehicles,
        };
    we will get above things when we call useUserStore() function in any file under provider. 
    Check App.js file where we used Provider and then in any file we need context methods & data we can import this method there and simply call it to get things.
